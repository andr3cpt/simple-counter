## Description
There are plenty of basic JS counters out there, and this is no exception; nevertheless, I often find that the sole focus of such exercises is on the functionality, and while this should certainly be the main point, their appearance often leaves a lot to be desired.
It is equally important that an application, no matter how simple, is visually appealing, because that conveys an idea of quality to the end-user.

I wanted my counter to look like a stylized version of a physical product; the idea is that one can just take it out of their pocket and have  it ready, without distracting/cluttered graphics. 

## Functionality
Aside from the main div containers in the HTML, the rest is created and implemented via the DOM in JS.
I chose to prevent the counter from going below 0, because that's the way I imagine it should be in most every-day situations. 
I mainly thought of this counter as a simple, useful tool for keeping score during a game, in which each player can respectively pull out their phones and have it ready.


## Responsiveness
Speaking of phones, I chose to make the app responsive; it shrinks for mobile viewports. Resize the window to see this in effect.

## UI/UX
Being passionate with design and having usability in mind, I chose to have 3 large and equally spaced buttons, with the minus sign in red, the plus sign in green (maily because it's intuitive and the colors help differentiate), and a reset button in blue. The buttons are also reactive, with hover and active states, so that they're perfectly adaptable to both a desktop and a mobile environment. I chose to use a subtle drop shadow to give the app a sleek, modern, minimalistic look, in accordance with contemporary UI trends.
